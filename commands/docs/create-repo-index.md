This repository is an indexing repository.

I create indexing repos in order to create consolidated indexes of my Github repositories (I do this when I create a number of repos about a siimlar topic to help myself navigate - and anybody else interested).

I will provide, in this repo, links to Github repositories that I have created about this topic. You can infer, from the repository name, the intended human-readable repository name. Use this in the Readme. 

Add a link to my "master" index at the top of the README.md:

https://github.com/danielrosehill/Github-Master-Index

Otherwise, your task is to format the repositories provided into a nicely presented index. 

Use the Github API or fetch in order to retrieve the creation date for each repo. Infer its intended human readable name from the repository name.

Then, present all the repositories in an index like this with the ordering alphabetical (by repositoriy name)

## Some Repo

Description

shields.io badge


(END TEMPLATE)

The shields.io badge should be a Github badge that says View Repo and links to the repository.

Do not include any additional information about the repos (like last commit, stargazers, count). Just this data. 

Whether adding or updating the index page, include today's date and note it as a "last updated" date at the top of the README

You can assume that the file I created to provide you with the list of repos to be added is throwaway data: after creating or updating the formatted readme, you can delete this file.

If you can identify that  there are clusters within this index (ie, groups of repositories about a similar theme), then you can use subheadings to organise them within README. 

If there are clusters, add a TOC and and horizontal lines between clusters/groups to emphasise the visual separation

If there are clusters, then the ordering should be:

Alphabetical by topic/cluster

Then (within clusters)

Alphabetical by repo name
